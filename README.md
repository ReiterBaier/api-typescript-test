This is my first API in typescript, I'm using the libraries:
express, typeORM, mysql, routing-controllers

API composed of two routes:
**/zip_code/${codigoCep}**
**/city/${codigoIbge}**

Its purpose is to return the cadastral data of a city or zip code, from an ibge code or zip code used as url path.
